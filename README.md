# Image Gallery with Text Overlay, Subarray Sum, and String Transform (JavaScript)
This project showcases three functionalities:

## Image Gallery with Text Overlay: 
An HTML and JavaScript combination to create an image gallery with text overlays that appear on hover.

## Subarray Sum: 
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous
subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists,
otherwise return false.


## String Transform:
 A JavaScript function to transform a string according to specific rules (
● If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
● If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
● If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
both operations in the order specified above.
).

# Setting Up the Project
Clone or Download the Repository:

If you have Git installed, clone the repository using the following command:
```Bash 
git clone https://github.com/bahati7/coa-taskforce-challenge.git
```

Otherwise, download the project files as a zip archive.
Open the HTML Files:

The project consists of two folders:
I photoGallery: This folder contains the image gallery code.

To test this code:
1. Open the photoGallery folder in Vs Code
2. Go to the extensions and install live server
3. Inside index.html, right click and click open with live server
4. Then you will see the image gallery in your browser

II Challenges: This folder contains two files.

arrayMap.js: This file demonstrates the subarray sum functionality.
stringTransform.js: This file would contain the code for your string transform function.
Open these files in a web browser to view the results.

## Note:

Running the JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code for the subarray sum functionalities and string Transform can be tested by using an online code editor. You will need to copy the entire code and paste it here to see the results: https://playcode.io/javascript

Image Gallery Hover Effect:

Hover over the images in the gallery to see the text overlays appear from the bottom.

Subarray Sum:

The arrayMap file provides a basic example of how the subarray sum function is used. You can modify the code to test it with different input arrays.

string transform functionality:

The Implemented logic for the string transformation function is designated in JavaScript file stringTransform.js.


## Additional Notes
This is a basic project to showcase the functionalities. You can customize the HTML and CSS to style the gallery and user interface according to your preferences.
Feel free to explore further functionalities and improvements for the subarray sum and string transform implementations.
